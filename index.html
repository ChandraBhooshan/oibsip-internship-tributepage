          ( Pāli सिद्धार्थ गौतम: Gotama Buddh) was a spiritual teacher from the
          ancient Indian subcontinent and the historical founder of Buddhism. He
          is universally recognized by Buddhists as the Supreme Buddha of our
          age. The time of his birth and death are uncertain; most modern
          historians date his lifetime from 563 BCE to 483 BCE, though some have
          suggested a date about a century later than this.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gautama is the key figure in Buddhism, and
          accounts of his life, discourses, and monastic rules were summarized
          after his death and memorized by the saṅgha. Passed down by oral
          tradition, the Tripiṭaka, the collection of discourses attributed to
          Gautama, was committed to writing about 400 years later.

        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem">Buddha's life</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As few of the details of the Buddha's life can
          be independently verified, it is difficult to gauge the historical
          accuracy of these accounts. The main sources of information on
          Siddhārtha Gautam's life are the earliest available Buddhist texts.
          The following is a summary of those narratives.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h5>Conception and birth:</h5>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to tradition, Siddhārtha was
              born more than 200 years before the reign of the Maurya king Aśoka
              (lived 304–232 BCE).
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siddhartha was born in Lumbini in modern
              day Nepal. His father was Suddhodan, the chief of the Shakya
              nation, one of several ancient tribes on the growing state of
              Kosala. His mother was Queen Maya, King Sudhodhana's wife.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Marriage:</h5>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young Prince Siddhārtha Gautama
              was a baby, an ascetic named Kaladevala went into the Trāyastriṃśa
              heaven and predicted that the young prince would become the
              Buddha. As the boy reached the age of 16, his father arranged his
              marriage to Yaśodharā ( Pāli: Yasodharā), a cousin of the same
              age.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, she gave birth to a son, Rahula.
              Gautama spent 29 years as a prince in Kapilavastu, a place now
              situated in Nepal. Although his father ensured that Gautama was
              provided with everything he could want or need, Gautama felt that
              material wealth was not the ultimate goal of life...
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>The Great Departure:</h5>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While venturing outside of his palace,
              Gautama is said to have seen an old crippled man ( old age), a
              diseased man ( illness), a decaying corpse ( death), and an
              ascetic. These four scenes are referred to as the four sights, or
              the four heavenly messengers ( Pali: devaduta). Deeply depressed
              by these sights, he sought to overcome old age, illness, and death
              by living the life of an ascetic. Gautama soon left his palace,
              his possessions, and his entire family at age 29, to take up the
              lonely life of a wandering monk.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoning his inheritance, he is then
              said to have dedicated his life to learning how to overcome
              suffering. He meditated with two hermits, and, although he
              achieved high levels of meditative consciousness, he was still not
              satisfied with his path...
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>The Great Enlightenment:</h5>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asceticism and concentrating on
              meditation or Anapana-sati (awareness of breathing in and out),
              Gautama is said to have discovered what Buddhists call the Middle
              Way—a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence
              and self-mortification. He accepted a little rice pudding from a
              village girl named Sujata. Then, sitting under a pipal tree, now
              known as the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, he vowed never to arise
              until he had found the Truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the age of 35, he attained
              Enlightenment; according to some traditions, this occurred
              approximately in May, and according to others in December.
              Gautama, from then on, was known as "The Perfectly Self-Awakened
              One", the Samyaksambuddha ( Pāli: Sammāsambuddha)...
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>The Great Passing:</h5>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of
              the Pali canon, at the age of 80, the Buddha announced that he
              would soon enter Parinirvana or the final deathless state
              abandoning the earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his last
              meal, which, according to different translations, was either a
              mushroom delicacy or soft pork, which he had received as an
              offering from a blacksmith named Cunda.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed
              his attendant Ānanda to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his
              place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal would
              be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the much-needed
              energy for the Buddha.
